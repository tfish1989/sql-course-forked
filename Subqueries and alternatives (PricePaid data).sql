Land Registry Price Paid dataset

Question: which postcodes in SW12 have not had a single property sale since the Land Registry records begin?
Table PostcodeSW12, from the ONS, contains every postcode in SW12
The pcds column matches the PricePaidSW12.PostCode column. pcds is a unique key.
This is the post code format with a single space between the two parts.
The PostcodeSW12 contains lots of other attributes for the post code e.g. lat and long

-- sample the data

SELECT TOP 10 * FROM PostcodeSW12;

SELECT TOP 10 * FROM PricePaidSW12;


/*
NOT IN self-contained query approach
*/
SELECT pcds FROM PostcodeSW12 c WHERE c.pcds NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT PostCode FROM PricePaidSW12 );

/*

SELECT
    pcds
FROM PostcodeSW12 c
WHERE NOT EXISTS
    (SELECT 1 FROM PricePaidSW12 WHERE PostCode = c.pcds);

  /*
LEFT JOIN approach

The LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the PostcodeSW12 table and will return a NULL value for any column on PricePaidSW12
where there is no match.
The query filters rows where a PricePaidSW12 column IS NULL and so returns the postcode without sales
