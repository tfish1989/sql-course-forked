Using a table alias (ps in the example below) is good practice and helps in a few ways 
1. the autocomplete will list the column names
2. when there are several tables, it is easier to identfy which column from which table

some alternative WHERE clauses.  Try these out

WHERE ps.Hospital = 'PRUH'; -- column = value

WHERE ps.Hospital IN ('PRUH', 'Kingston'); -- column in (list of values)
WHERE ps.AdmittedDate BETWEEN '2024-03-02' AND '2024-03-04';

LIKE allows partial matches
_ means any single character
% means 0 or more characters

GROUP BY and aggregate
Aggregate is to get a single result from a set of numbers
Aggregation functions include SUM() and COUNT(*) but also MIN(), MAX(), AVERAGE()..
We can group by at whatever level of aggregation we need and calculate several aggregations

We can join the PatientStay and DimHospital on the column columns, named Hospital in both tables.
